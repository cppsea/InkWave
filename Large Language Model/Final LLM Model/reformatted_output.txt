**Study Tips**

**Prepare Before Class:**
- Review notes from the last class.
- Look through the chapter to understand the basic idea of this class.
- May take 20-30 mins but makes a huge difference.

**When in Doubt, Write it Down:**
- Don't waste time deciding if you should write something down. 
- Focus on main points and ideas.
- Don't write everything. Leave out unnecessary words.

**Think About Your Notes:**
- Use abbreviations and include a key for lecture-specific abbreviations. 
  - For example, in a lecture about King Henry VIII, instead of writing his name out each time, make a note such as King Henry VIII = H8. If this could be confused with King Henry VII, abbreviate it as King Henry VIII = 8.

**Know Your Professor:**
- Use the note-taking method that will best help you with this particular professor's lectures.
  - A more organized professor works well with the Cornell style.
  - Use the note-taking method for visual learners for a professor that jumps around and returns to previous points.
- Show the professor your notes after the first lecture and ask if you are hitting the main points.
