Study Tips
- Prepare before class
  - Review notes from last class
  - Look through chapter to understand basic idea of this class
  - May take 20-30 mins but makes a huge difference
- When in doubt, write it down
  - Point: write everything through Main Points Main Ideas
  - Don't spend too long deciding if you should write down
- Thin your notes
  - Don't write everything. Leave out words.
  - Use abbreviations - include a key of specific-for-this lecture abbreviations. e.g., A lecture about King Henry VIII will require you to repeat his name several times. Instead of writing it out each time, make a note: King Henry 
VIII = H8. For that would be confused with King Henry VII, abbreviate it as King Henry VIII = 8.
- Know your prof
  - Use the note-taking method that will best help you with this particular prof's lectures.
  - A more organized prof works well with the Cornell style. Use the note-taking method for visual learners for a prof that jumps around and returns to previous points.
- Show the prof your notes after the first lecture and ask if you are hitting main points.
